            CVLTURE CREW is a diverse collective of Painters, Designers, DJ's, Producers, MC's, Musicians, and die-hard concert-goers.
            Every company & collective has a story. Ours begins in the underground music & arts communities of Cincinnati, OH. Owner/Operator, Jon G Ferreri Jr, began this company during his own creative journey as a Conscious Hip Hop artist infatuated with Jazz, EDM, Funk, and visual arts. Knowing it couldn't be managed alone, he was then joined by CJ Schiff, a fellow Cincinnati native who was equally in-love with the Night Life and the creative wonders that fuel it's fire. Our family is ever-growing and determined to bring you boundless insight into the creative world, as well as offer platforms and services to take creators to their next level in their careers/passions.
            The real magic is from our incredible #crew of entertainers & event support #crew.
