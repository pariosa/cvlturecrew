           Every company and collective has a story. Our narrative begins in the underground music & arts communities of Cincinnati, OH. Owner/Operator, Jon G Ferreri Jr, launched our collective during his own creative journey as a Conscious Hip Hop artist; infatuated with Jazz, EDM, Funk, and visual arts. Knowing it couldn't be managed alone, he was later joined by CJ Schiff, a fellow Cincinnati native who was equally in-love with the Night Life and the creative wonders that fuel it's fire. Our family is ever-growing and determined to bring you boundless insight into the creative world, as well as offer platforms and services to take creators to their next level in their careers/passions. 
           	<br/><br/>
The real magic is our incredible crew of creators, and you, our family who joins the experience.
